# Group ToDo List
A beginner level smart contract assignment for a simple group to-do list.

# Description
Each ToDo will have:
- Assignee <br>
  only asignee can change the status of the task to done
- Assigner <br>
  only the contract deployer (group leader) can assign task <br>
  assigner may reassign the task if it HAS NOT been completed by the current assignee
- Task <br>
  the name of the task
- Status <br>
  to indicate complete/incompleted, initially the status should be incompleted

<b>Only addresses that are part of the group (the group leader/assigner and those who are assigned a task can view the ToDo List.<b>

Challenge:
- Add deadline date to the ToDo property (Clue: Unix Timestamp)
